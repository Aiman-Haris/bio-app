Story,Ivan goes vacation in Thailand. Enjoys the trip food there too much.  ,
,got food poisoning. (might be raw meats that have bacteria or street foods that got flies),"sakit perut , street food with flies"
,Ivan goes to doctor. Undergoes series of tests ,jumpa dr. 
,doctor checks and diagnosed might be food poisoning and he explains about third line defense so Ivan got nothing to worry. ,
